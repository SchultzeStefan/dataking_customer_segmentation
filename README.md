#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project was to practise the knowlendge we learned in the Machine Learning weeks at Data Science Bootcamp. We selected an Unsupervised Learning task of segmentation of credit card customers.

### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics
* Unsupervised Machine Learning - k-Nearest Neighbours
* Data Visualization
* Dimensionality Reduction - TSNE

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter

## Project Description
We were given a dataset of credit card transactions. The dataset contained 8500 customers and their activity over a 6-month period. Each transaction was characterized by 18 features.

Our task was to find the most useful customer segmentation to improve the marketing campaigns of the company.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages)
create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
